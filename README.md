# Ovation-exercise
This is a simple website made out of just one web page. It has a button that when clicked displays the title of the first post on reddit.

At first I wanted to use reddit's API. I followed the instrucitons outlined on https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api and attempted to fill the google doc with the Reddit API Terms of Use. However, when asked for an OAuth Client ID I was not able to provide one. The link to fill this part out (https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) is not functional. 

To get around this issue I decided to use an html parser called Nokogiri.
